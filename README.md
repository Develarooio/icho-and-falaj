# icho-and-falaj

A game of discovery and wisdom wherein you navigate the treetops as Falaj, the flowy sloth being, accompanied by Icho, a small glowing entity, in search of Our Natural Father.

# World

## Swinging

Although Falaj can walk and leap, his most identifying mode of traversal is by swinging between the boughs of the trees. Long, somewhat elastic arms enable this.

## Day and Night

Day and night are short in Our Father's Forest

# Cast

## Main

### Falaj

Falaj is a well-meaning and naive sloth-spirit with a flowing mane of hair and stretchy arms which allow him to swing through the Forest. Falaj takes but he does not keep.

### Icho

It's unclear what or who Icho is, but it bears some resemblance to the forest fairies. Despite this similarity, Icho behaves nothing like his brethren and instead clings to Falaj's mane.

## Forest Spirits

### Som-som

Som-som is the first of the blue spirits. She expresses the spirit of the mole, and praises sleep to her listeners.

### Tango

Tango is the livelier of the blue spirits and her laughing energizes and rejuvenates.

### Our Natural Father

The oldest and most centered of the forest beings, Our Natural Father whiles away infinite hours in the Wisdom Dispensary,  communicating only in cryptic sayings. If one stops to listen to his sayings, Our Natural Father is likely to bequeath them with a wisdom nugget as a gift.

## Buds

Icho and Falaj are not alone in the forest wanderings. Indeed, the forest is full of life and Falaj frequently encounters his buds, who, despite initial coyness, enjoy opening themselves to passers-by and sharing their stories with willing listeners.

### Tora

### Dorito

### Eric



# Mechanics

## Stones

The forest floor is littered with mossy stones of various sizes. Falaj can carry a number of stones of varying sizes. If he encounters (or places) a stone on the forest floor, he may stack another smaller stone on top of it in order to build a shrine.

## Shrines

Shrines are stacks of stone built on the forest floor. Forest beings find comfort in proximity to these shrines and at night they congregate around them, enjoying their soft glow and a sense of togetherness. Larger shines glow brighter and thus attract more forest denizens. In some cases, if a shrine is big enough, the night dark enough, and the moon bright enough, forest fairies will travel to the shrine and perform rituals. If Icho is present during one of these events, it's possible that one of the blue spirits will appear.

## Mushrooms

The forest is lush with blue and red capped mushrooms which, if eaten, cause the consumer to fall into a calm and reflective state, ideal for bonding and communion.

## The Wisdom Dispensary

The wisdom dispensary is the hidden domicile of Our Natural Father. Entry to The Wisdom Dispensary is allowed only to those who bring acceptable offerings.

## Forest Fairies

In the darkest nights, the forest is still lit by the most minor of the forest spirits. Sometimes mistaken for fireflies, the fairies of the forest are aimless but not purposeless and drift between the trees unhurriedly.
